Preheat oven to 180Â°C. Line a rimmed baking tray with baking paper. Use a large sharp knife to cut the tops from the apples about 2cm from stem ends. Reserve apple tops. Use a small spoon to scoop out the apple cores, leaving the bottoms intact. Score a line around the centre of each apple. 
Combine date, walnut, cinnamon, ginger and 2 tbs water in a bowl. Divide evenly among the apples. Place the apples on the lined tray. Replace tops. Bake for 45 mins or until apples are tender. Set aside to cool slightly. 
Drizzle apples with maple syrup or honey and top with a scoop of Halo Top. Sprinkle with biscuit.
