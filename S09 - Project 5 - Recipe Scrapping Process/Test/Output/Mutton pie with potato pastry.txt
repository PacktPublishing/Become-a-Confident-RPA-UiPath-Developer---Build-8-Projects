1.5kg diced lamb (shoulder or leg)2 tablespoons plain flour (seasoned with salt and pepper)2 tablespoons olive oil25g unsalted butter4 large onions, thinly sliced2 garlic cloves, crushed200ml red wine300ml Massel beef stock (see Notes)2 bay leaves2 sprigs of thyme1 egg, lightly beaten

Preheat the oven to 160°C. 
Toss lamb in flour. Heat half the oil in a large ovenproof casserole over high heat. Brown lamb in batches, set aside. Turn heat to medium, add remaining oil and the butter to pan, then add onions and cook for 5 minutes or until soft. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute, then return meat to pan with wine, stock and herbs. Season with salt and pepper, bring to boil, then cover and place in oven for 1 1/2 hours until meat is tender. Cool, then transfer to a 1.5-litre pie dish. 
Meanwhile, make pastry. Sift flour into a large bowl with a good pinch of salt. 
Rub in butter with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Add potato and bring together using your hands until a smooth ball forms. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes. 
Preheat oven to 180°C. Roll out pastry on a floured board until slightly larger than the pie dish. Cut a 1cm-wide strip from around outside edge of pastry, then press it around rim of the dish. Brush pastry rim with water, then cover pie with remaining pastry. Trim excess and use to decorate. Make 2 slits in top, brush with egg and bake for 30 minutes or until golden. Serve with neeps & tatties and roast parsnips, leeks, apples & bacon (see related recipes).
